Used to wrestle HCL in endless lines,
Copy-paste blocks, tangled up in confines.
Terraform files stacked high in the night,
Hoping a stray bracket won’t ruin our flight.

But then came the shift, a cleaner design—
Object-oriented, reusable divine.
TerraConstructs showed the way,
Now we build with ease day by day.

From boilerplate to flow,
We let the constructs grow.
Intent-driven code, taking control,
Cloud services sculpted as gold.
No more modules lost in the haze—
Patterns we trust, in clear arrays.
With TerraConstructs we rise,
Unlocking dev experience to the skies.

No more spinning wheels in module hell,
Just high-level constructs that work so well.
Define once, reuse across the land,
Infrastructure built with a guiding hand.

Lambda, VPCs, scaling in a breeze—
Patterns so clean, it’s like art with ease.
CDKTF brings the best of both worlds,
Terraform ecosystem, with OOP unfurled.
We code in lines that say what we mean,
Not cryptic blocks—they’re crisp and clean.

From boilerplate to flow,
We let the constructs grow.

Cloud services sculpted as gold.
No more modules lost in the haze—
Patterns we trust, in clear arrays.
With TerraConstructs we rise,
Unlocking dev experience to the skies.

Goodbye HCL mess, we’re finally free—
With TerraConstructs, infrastructure sings with glee.
Built once, used everywhere, seamless and bright—
We’ve moved on through the boilerplate to infrastructure done right.
